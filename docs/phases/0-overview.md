# Game Insights: Open Source Roadmap

**Mission:** Make indie game developers independent by giving them enterprise-level analytics with zero complexity.

**Vision:** Upload any data, get instant insights, no data engineering required.

---

## Why This Matters

Indie developers are at a massive disadvantage:

| Challenge | Big Studios | Indie Devs |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Data Engineering | Dedicated team | Just the dev |
| Analytics Tools | $10k+/month tools | Spreadsheets |
| Expertise | Data scientists | "I just make games" |
| Time | Months to build | Ship or die |

**Game Insights levels the playing field.**

## Design Principles

### 1. Zero-Config First
Default behavior should work for 90% of users without any configuration.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Simple by default, power features available when needed.

### 3. Local-First
Data stays on user's machine unless they explicitly choose to share.

### 4. Open & Transparent
Open source, open development, community-driven roadmap.

### 5. Indie-Friendly
Affordable (free/open source), simple, focused on what indie devs actually need.
